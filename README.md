A Matrimony Website built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clean code separation, scalability, and maintainability. The application features a well-structured RESTful API for performing CRUD operations and handles file uploads efficiently using Multer, a middleware for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js.
